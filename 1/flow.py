a = 10


print("a < 12: " + (str)(a < 12))

print("a > 12: " + (str)(a > 12))

# Example 2
if True :
    print("It was true")
else:
    print("It was false")

# Example 3
if a < 12:
    print("It was true")
else:
    print("It was false")

# When the program executes the second two examples evaluate to be the same

# a is equal to 10 and 10 is less than 12 so that evaluates to True
